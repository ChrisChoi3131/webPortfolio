                    The past 2 years I worked with Chris(Yongrak) at 'Hackingzone'(bug bounty platform), I had the best time as a product manager.When I met Chris(Yongrak), for the first time, he's a
                    front-end engineer. At the beginning of the project, our team was a very small team. So he should be a lead developer and he should decide our development architecture. As a
                    full-stack engineer, he was responsible for all aspects of development. (e.g. back-end development, front-end development, publishing and establishing configuration policy & build
                    pipeline etc) Basically he has a growth mindset, and he always seeks to find his improvements by actively seeking feedback from his colleagues.Because of his eagerness for growth,
                    he grows very fast. As a development leader, he motivates team members with shared understanding of vision and goals. When the tension of the team members came loose, he showed
                    appropriate stimulation and motivating leadership, leading the Hackingzone team not to deviate from the direction to achieve the success goal. Chris also considers the business
                    side of our product. In order to penetrate into the Korean bug bounty market, our team had to release our platform as quickly as possible. So he asked a lot of questions to share
                    the vision/goals of the Hackingzone team, and thankfully gave advanced ideas to move forward. Also when our consensus was formed, as mentioned above, his servant leadership was
                    shown by acting as a development leader & scrum master to make the team as a self-organizing team. When communicating between the business team and the development team, he has a
                    capacity of communicating with each side with the excellent metaphor. When the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting our team health, Chris maintained a sustainable pace by communicating
                    with his team members online continuously. I was very happy to meet be the same team with Chris. I also learned from Chris's attitude for seeking self-improvements and driving
                    toward success. In the current VUCA environment, we should have business agility because of the survival of the company. Anyone who wants to make a growing team rapidly and
                    continuously, with Chris, it is possible to create a self-organizing & self-managing team. I'm confident that finding and working with Chris will be a great opportunity to make
                    your team very healthy and your product wonderfully.

                    If only a few words were allowed to introduce Yongrak I would say, He is the Engineer who solves problems. Yongrak and I have worked together since the beginning of the brand new
                    in-house venture project team, Hackingzone, which recently have been approved for spin-off and seed funding by Samsung SDS. Though Yongrak and I decided to pursue another career
                    path other than Hackingzone, 2 years that I had spent with him was just enough time to know that he is a problem solver and he always dedicate himself to deal with the issues. We
                    needed to set up web portal for hackers and enterprise users from the very bottom and nothing was given to us. And that was the point he proved his existence: he decided which
                    cloud, database, languages for front-end and bak-end to use and how to manage github branches, code conventions of the project, CI/CD, image/file server, data encryption and test
                    environment. There were hundreds of tasks to be done for the successful initiation of the new business and he had done it step by step with sincerity and enthusiasm. It was great
                    journey for me that I could have worked with Yongrak because not only he has remarkable skills to solve problem, but he is also a great motivator by showing that any challenges and
                    issues can be resolved. Additionally he always come to people and say hi first and that is another reason that I have enjoyed working together with him. I am sure that wherever he
                    work and whoever he work with, he will contribute to that organization and grow together. I also am willing to work with him again anywhere, anytime in the future.

                    For the five years I worked with him, he was my mentor and he was always an inspiration to me. Yongrak is one of the most brilliant engineers I have worked with. I had the pleasure
                    of working with him for 5 years at Samsung where he has easily become one of the most dependable engineers in the team. His passion towards learning new things and taking up more
                    work inspires the team to go above and beyond. Needless to say, Yongrak is that right combination of enthusiasm and detailed. He is a self-starter and analyse the problem well and
                    comes up with a holistic solution. I really enjoy his way of work process around building longterm sustainable and scalable solutions. He is someone whom we can rely on getting the
                    job done and more. He brings his best to the work and makes it a good place to work. His passion towards new technologies and trends is very inspiring. He is always willing to
                    share his learnings and makes the work a very collaborative experience.

                    It is my great pleasure to recommend Mr. Yongrak Choi to you. I had worked with Mr. Choi for 6 years (2014~2019) in Samsung SDS. During this period, we mainly operated the SAP
                    Enterprise Portal system of Samsung Electronics. Choi successfully carried out many projects to streamline the system while operating the system. He was always interested in the
                    latest technology and development methodologies and made a lot of efforts to apply them to actual work. Mr. Choi also volunteered to help other colleagues. I very much appreciate
                    his proactive and altruistic attitude. Due to the characteristics described above, I can say with confidence that Mr. Choi will be a valuable asset to your team. If you have any
